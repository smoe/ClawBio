## What ClawBio Does Today

**40+ executable skills + 8,000 Galaxy tools. Local-first. No cloud. No guessing.**

Snap a photo of a medication in Telegram. ClawBio identifies the drug from the packaging, queries your pharmacogenomic profile from [your own genome](docs/demo-genome.md), and returns a personalised dosage card — on your machine, in seconds:

<p align="center">
  <img src="skills/drug-photo/demo-images/00-00-warfarin.jpg" width="360" alt="Warfarin 2mg medication packaging — ClawBio identifies the drug from a photo and returns a personalised pharmacogenomic report">
</p>

> **Warfarin** | CYP2C9 \*1/\*2 Intermediate · VKORC1 High Sensitivity
> **AVOID — DO NOT USE** · Standard dose causes over-anticoagulation in this genotype.

Or take any genetic variant (identified by its rsID — a unique label like [rs9923231](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs9923231)) and search nine genomic databases at once to find every known disease association, tissue-specific effect, and population frequency. Or estimate your genetic predisposition to conditions like type 2 diabetes by combining thousands of small-effect variants into a single polygenic risk score. Or explore the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) — a half-million-person research dataset — by asking in plain English what fields measure blood pressure, grip strength, or depression, and get back the exact field IDs, descriptions, and linked publications you need.

Every result ships with a reproducibility bundle: `commands.sh`, `environment.yml`, and SHA-256 checksums. A reviewer can reproduce your Figure 3 in 30 seconds without emailing you.

---

## Reference Genome

ClawBio's demo data is built on a real, fully open human genome: the **Corpasome**. The [23andMe SNP chip](docs/demo-genome.md) (~600K variants) has been available since launch. Now, the project also ships subsets from a **30x Illumina whole-genome sequence** (GRCh37), covering ~4M SNPs, ~600K indels, and structural variants (DEL, DUP, INV, BND, INS, CNVs). All data comes from a single individual (Manuel Corpas), licensed CC0, and published on Zenodo ([doi:10.5281/zenodo.19297389](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19297389)). This dataset is provided for research and educational purposes only.

See [docs/reference-genome.md](docs/reference-genome.md) for use cases, subsets, and citation details.

## The Problem

You read a paper. You want to reproduce Figure 3. So you:

1. Go to GitHub. Clone the repo.
2. Wrong Python version. Fix dependencies.
3. Need the reference data — where is it?
4. Download 2GB from Zenodo. **Link is dead.**
5. Email the first author. **Wait 3 weeks.**
6. Paths are hardcoded to `/home/jsmith/data/`.
7. Two days later: still broken. **You give up.**

Now imagine the same paper published a **skill**:

```bash
python ancestry_pca.py --demo --output fig3
# Figure 3 reproduced. Identical. SHA-256 verified. 30 seconds.
```

**That's ClawBio.** Every figure in your paper should be one command away from reproduction.

---

## What Is ClawBio?

Current agentic bioinformatics systems address either the **reasoning layer** (constraining LLM outputs with knowledge graphs or fine-tuning) or the **connectivity layer** (wrapping tools as MCP servers). Neither addresses the **specification layer**: the encoding of a domain expert's analytical decisions into a machine-readable contract that constrains agent behaviour. Without this layer, the agent must reconstruct expert knowledge from its training distribution, a stochastic, unversioned process.

A **skill** is a self-contained directory comprising a declarative specification (`SKILL.md`), validated Python code, demo data, and a reproducibility bundle (`commands.sh`, `environment.yml`, SHA-256 checksums). The specification is a contract, not a prompt: it encodes the domain expert's analytical decisions so the LLM orchestrates but does not improvise.

```
Ad-hoc LLM code generation  = stochastic, unversioned, unverifiable
ClawBio skill                = specification-constrained, versioned, reproducible
```

- **Specification-first**: Domain expertise resides in `SKILL.md`, not in model weights. Specifications are versioned, human-readable, peer-reviewable, and trivially updatable.
- **Agent-agnostic**: Skills execute identically whether invoked by Claude, ChatGPT, or a locally hosted model via Ollama. Reproducibility is decoupled from any specific AI vendor.
- **Local-first**: Your genomic data never leaves your laptop. No cloud uploads, no data exfiltration.
- **Reproducible**: Every analysis exports `commands.sh`, `environment.yml`, and SHA-256 checksums. Anyone can reproduce it without the agent.
- **MIT licensed**: Open-source, free, community-driven.

## Why Not Just Use an LLM?

Ask any LLM to "profile the pharmacogenes in my VCF file." It will produce plausible Python. But the code may use outdated CPIC guidelines, hallucinate star allele functional classifications, or confuse reduced-function and no-function alleles. CYP2D6\*4 is a no-function allele; misclassifying it as reduced-function determines whether a patient receives a dose adjustment or is told to avoid a drug entirely. Approximately 7% of individuals of European ancestry are CYP2D6 poor metabolisers for whom codeine provides zero analgesic effect, and roughly 0.5% carry DPYD variants where standard fluorouracil dosing can be lethal.

An LLM should not be improvising these from training data. ClawBio encodes the correct bioinformatics decisions in versioned, peer-reviewable specifications so the agent executes them correctly every time.

---

## Provenance and Reproducibility

Every ClawBio analysis ships with a **reproducibility bundle** — not as an afterthought, but as part of the output:

```
report/
├── report.md              # Full analysis with figures and tables
├── figures/               # Publication-quality PNGs
├── tables/                # CSV data tables
├── commands.sh            # Exact commands to reproduce
├── environment.yml        # Conda environment snapshot
└── checksums.sha256       # SHA-256 of every input and output file
```

**Why this matters**: a reviewer can re-run your analysis in 30 seconds. A collaborator can reproduce your Figure 3 without emailing you. Future-you can regenerate results two years later from the same bundle.

## Genomebook

**Genomebook** is a synthetic-genetics sandbox built into ClawBio. It turns fictional or historical character profiles ("souls") into diploid genomes, scores compatibility, and breeds offspring across generations, complete with Mendelian inheritance, de novo mutations, and clinical evaluation.

### Pipeline

```
SOUL.md  -->  Soul2DNA  -->  .genome.json  -->  GenomeMatch  -->  Recombinator  -->  Gen-N offspring
 (trait       (compiler)     (diploid loci)     (M x F rank)     (meiosis +        (.genome.json
  scores)                                                         mutation)          with clinical
                                                                                     history)
```

### Data

- **20 souls** in `GENOMEBOOK/DATA/SOULS/` (Einstein, Curie, Turing, Hypatia, Da Vinci, ...)
- **20 generation-0 genomes** in `GENOMEBOOK/DATA/GENOMES/`
- **26 traits** across 55 loci (trait_registry.json)
- **Disease registry** with penetrance, fitness costs, and onset probabilities

### Quick Start

```bash
# Compile all souls to genomes
python skills/soul2dna/soul2dna.py --demo

# Score all M x F compatibility pairings
python skills/genome-match/genome_match.py --demo

# Breed Einstein x Anning (3 offspring)
python skills/recombinator/recombinator.py --demo
```

### What It Models

- **Additive, dominant, recessive** inheritance at each locus
- **Heterozygosity advantage** (heterosis) in compatibility scoring
- **Carrier risk** flagging for autosomal recessive conditions
- **De novo mutations** with hotspot categories (cognitive, immune, metabolic)
- **Clinical evaluation** with penetrance, onset probability, and fitness costs
- **Health scores** derived from cumulative condition burden

## Skills in Detail

### PharmGx Reporter — *Personal Scale*

Generates a pharmacogenomic report from consumer genetic data (23andMe, AncestryDNA):

- Parses raw genetic data (auto-detects format, including gzip)
- Extracts **31 pharmacogenomic SNPs** across **12 genes** (CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, VKORC1, SLCO1B1, DPYD, TPMT, UGT1A1, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, NUDT15, CYP1A2)
- Calls star alleles and determines metabolizer phenotypes
- Looks up **CPIC drug recommendations** for **51 medications**
- Zero dependencies. Runs in **< 1 second**.

```bash
python pharmgx_reporter.py --input demo_patient.txt --output report
```

**Demo result**: CYP2D6 \*4/\*4 (Poor Metabolizer) → **10 drugs AVOID** (codeine, tramadol, 7 TCAs, tamoxifen), 20 caution, 21 standard.

> ~7% of people are CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers — codeine gives them zero pain relief. ~0.5% carry DPYD variants where standard 5-FU dose can be lethal. This skill catches both.

### Drug Photo — *Personal Scale*

Snap a photo of any medication in Telegram. ClawBio identifies the drug from the packaging and returns a personalised dosage card against your own genotype.

- Claude vision extracts drug name and visible dose from the photo
- Cross-references your 23andMe genotype against 31 PGx SNPs
- Four-tier classification: **STANDARD DOSING / USE WITH CAUTION / AVOID / INSUFFICIENT DATA**
- Correct VKORC1 complement-strand handling (23andMe reports minus strand for rs9923231)
- Works for warfarin, clopidogrel, codeine, simvastatin, tamoxifen, sertraline, and 20+ others

```bash
python pharmgx_reporter.py --drug warfarin --dose "5mg" --input my_23andme.txt --output report
```

> No command needed in Telegram — send any medication photo and RoboTerri triggers the skill automatically.

### GWAS Lookup — *Population Scale*

Federated variant query across nine genomic databases in a single command:

| Database | What you get |
|----------|-------------|
| GWAS Catalog | Genome-wide significant associations |
| gnomAD | Allele frequencies across 125,748 exomes |
| ClinVar | Clinical significance and condition links |
| Open Targets | Disease-gene evidence scores |
| Ensembl | Functional annotation, regulatory impact |
| GTEx | eQTL data, tissue-specific expression effects |
| LDlink | Linkage disequilibrium across 26 populations |
| UK Biobank PheWAS | Phenome-wide associations across 4,000+ traits |
| LOVD | Variant pathogenicity database |

```bash
python gwas_lookup.py --rsid rs3798220 --output report
python gwas_lookup.py --demo --output /tmp/gwas_lookup_demo
```

### UKB Navigator — *Research Scale*

Semantic search across the UK Biobank schema. Ask in plain English what UK Biobank measures about any phenotype — get field IDs, descriptions, data types, participant counts, and linked publications back instantly.

```bash
python ukb_navigator.py --query "grip strength"   --output report
python ukb_navigator.py --field 21001              --output report   # BMI
python ukb_navigator.py --demo                     --output /tmp/ukb_demo
```

Built on a ChromaDB embedding of the full UKB Data Showcase (22,000+ fields).

### Ancestry PCA — *Population Scale*

Runs principal component analysis on your cohort against the SGDP reference panel (345 samples, 164 global populations):

- Contig normalisation (chr1 vs 1)
- IBD removal (related individuals filtered)
- Common biallelic SNPs only
- Confidence ellipses per population
- Publication-quality **4-panel figure** generated instantly

```bash
python ancestry_pca.py --demo --output ancestry_report
```

**Demo result**: 736 Peruvian samples across 28 indigenous populations. Amazonian groups (Matzes, Awajun, Candoshi) sit in genetic space that no SGDP population occupies — genuinely underrepresented, not just in GWAS, but in the reference panels themselves.

### Semantic Similarity Index — *Systemic Scale*

Computes a Semantic Isolation Index for diseases using 13.1M PubMed abstracts and PubMedBERT embeddings (768-dim):

- **SII** (Semantic Isolation Index): higher = more isolated in literature
- **KTP** (Knowledge Transfer Potential): higher = more cross-disease spillover
- **RCC** (Research Clustering Coefficient): diversity of research approaches
- **Temporal Drift**: how research focus evolves over time
- Publication-quality **4-panel figure**

```bash
python semantic_sim.py --demo --output sem_report
```

**Key finding**: Neglected tropical diseases are **+38% more semantically isolated** (P < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.84). 14 of the 25 most isolated diseases are Global South priority conditions. Knowledge silos kill innovation — a malaria immunology breakthrough could help leishmaniasis, but the literatures don't talk to each other.

## Quick Start

### Clone and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ClawBio/ClawBio.git && cd ClawBio
pip install -r requirements.txt
python clawbio.py run pharmgx --demo
```

PharmGx demo runs in <2 seconds. Only needs Python 3.10+.

> **Note:** ClawBio is currently installed by cloning the repository. There is no `pip install clawbio` package yet (planned for a future release).

### Use as a Python library

```python
from clawbio import run_skill, list_skills

# List available skills
skills = list_skills()

# Run pharmacogenomics with demo data
result = run_skill("pharmgx", demo=True)

# Run with your own input
result = run_skill("gwas-lookup", rsid="rs3798220", output="/tmp/report")
```

### Install as a Claude Code plugin

Inside [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code):

```
/plugin marketplace add ClawBio/ClawBio
/plugin install clawbio
```

All skills are then available as agent-routable commands. Alternatively, clone the repo and open it as your working directory in Claude Code; the `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root teaches Claude how to route requests to skills automatically.

### Try all skills

```bash
python clawbio.py list                           # See available skills

```

### Run tests

```bash
pip install pytest
python -m pytest
```

### Dependencies

Core dependencies (`requirements.txt`): biopython, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, openai, pydeseq2. Most skills run with just these.

Some skills have additional requirements:

| Skill | Extra dependency | Install |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| Metagenomics | Kraken2, RGI, HUMAnN3 | Conda (see skill README) |
| Methylation Clock | PyAging | `pip install pyaging` |
| scRNA Embedding | scvi-tools | `pip install scvi-tools` |
| Galaxy Bridge | BioBlend | `pip install bioblend` |

No Docker or Singularity required for core functionality. Skills that need external bioinformatics tools document their setup in their own `SKILL.md`.

RoboTerri auto-detects file type (23andMe `.txt`, AncestryDNA `.csv`, VCF, FASTQ) and routes to the right skill via the Bio Orchestrator. Photos of medications trigger the Drug Photo skill automatically — no command needed.

## Galaxy Integration

ClawBio indexes **8,000+ bioinformatics tools** from [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org) via the Galaxy Bridge skill. Search by natural language, inspect tool schemas, and execute remotely — all from the CLI.

```bash
# Search Galaxy tools by keyword
python skills/galaxy-bridge/galaxy_bridge.py --search "metagenomics"

# Browse all 86 tool categories
python skills/galaxy-bridge/galaxy_bridge.py --list-categories

# Run a tool on Galaxy (requires GALAXY_API_KEY)
python skills/galaxy-bridge/galaxy_bridge.py --run fastqc --input reads.fq.gz --output results/

# Demo mode (offline, no API key)
python skills/galaxy-bridge/galaxy_bridge.py --demo
```

**Cross-platform chaining**: Galaxy VEP annotates variants → ClawBio PharmGx generates dosage report. Galaxy Kraken2 classifies reads → ClawBio metagenomics profiler. Neither can do this alone.

Built on [BioBlend](https://bioblend.readthedocs.io/) (Galaxy Python SDK). Developed in collaboration with the Galaxy ML SIG.

             │  Report      │     + reproducibility bundle
             └─────────────┘
```

Each skill is standalone — the orchestrator routes to the right one, but every skill also works independently. The `clawbio.run_skill()` API is importable by any agent (RoboTerri, RoboIsaac, Claude Code).

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full design.
