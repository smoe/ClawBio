## See It in Action

A community contributor built a nutrigenomics skill and ran it — from raw genetic data to personalised nutrition report with radar charts, heatmaps, and reproducibility bundle:

https://github.com/ClawBio/ClawBio/releases/download/v0.2.0/david-nutrigx-demo.mp4

<details>
<summary><strong>What just happened behind the scenes</strong></summary>

1. The AI agent read `SKILL.md` — a specification that encodes the correct bioinformatics decisions (40 SNPs, 13 nutrient domains, evidence-based risk thresholds)
2. It ran the Python skill **locally** — no genetic data left the machine
3. It produced a markdown report with figures, tables, and a **reproducibility bundle** (`commands.sh`, `environment.yml`, `checksums.sha256`)
4. Anyone can re-run the exact same analysis and get identical results, SHA-256 verified

## The Problem

You read a paper. You want to reproduce Figure 3. So you:

1. Go to GitHub. Clone the repo.
2. Wrong Python version. Fix dependencies.
3. Need the reference data — where is it?
4. Download 2GB from Zenodo. **Link is dead.**
5. Email the first author. **Wait 3 weeks.**
6. Paths are hardcoded to `/home/jsmith/data/`.
7. Two days later: still broken. **You give up.**

Now imagine the same paper published a **skill**:

```bash
python ancestry_pca.py --demo --output fig3
# Figure 3 reproduced. Identical. SHA-256 verified. 30 seconds.
```

**That's ClawBio.** Every figure in your paper should be one command away from reproduction.

## 🦖 What Is ClawBio?

A **skill** is a domain expert's knowledge — frozen into code — that an AI agent executes correctly every time.

```
ChatGPT / Claude  = a smart generalist who guesses at bioinformatics
🦖 ClawBio skill  = a domain expert's proven pipeline that the AI executes
```

- **Local-first**: Your genomic data never leaves your laptop. No cloud uploads, no data exfiltration.
- **Reproducible**: Every analysis exports `commands.sh`, `environment.yml`, and SHA-256 checksums. Anyone can reproduce it without the agent.
- **Modular**: Each skill is a self-contained directory (`SKILL.md` + Python scripts) that plugs into the orchestrator.
- **MIT licensed**: Open-source, free, community-driven.

## Why Not Just Use ChatGPT?

Ask Claude to "profile my pharmacogenes from this 23andMe file." It'll write plausible Python. But:

- It **hallucinates** star allele calls and uses outdated CPIC guidelines
- It **forgets** CYP2D6 \*4 is no-function (not reduced)
- You spend **45 minutes debugging** its output
- No reproducibility bundle. No audit log. No checksums.

ClawBio encodes the correct bioinformatics decisions so the agent gets it right first time, every time.

---

## 🔍 Provenance & Reproducibility

Every ClawBio analysis ships with a **reproducibility bundle** — not as an afterthought, but as part of the output:

```
report/
├── report.md              # Full analysis with figures and tables
├── figures/               # Publication-quality PNGs
├── tables/                # CSV data tables
├── commands.sh            # Exact commands to reproduce
├── environment.yml        # Conda environment snapshot
└── checksums.sha256       # SHA-256 of every input and output file
```

**Why this matters**: a reviewer can re-run your analysis in 30 seconds. A collaborator can reproduce your Figure 3 without emailing you. Future-you can regenerate results two years later from the same bundle.

## 🦖 MVP Skills in Detail

### PharmGx Reporter — *Personal Scale*

Generates a pharmacogenomic report from consumer genetic data (23andMe, AncestryDNA):

- Parses raw genetic data (auto-detects format)
- Extracts **31 pharmacogenomic SNPs** across **12 genes** (CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, VKORC1, SLCO1B1, DPYD, TPMT, UGT1A1, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, NUDT15, CYP1A2)
- Calls star alleles and determines metabolizer phenotypes
- Looks up **CPIC drug recommendations** for **51 medications**
- Zero dependencies. Runs in **< 1 second**.

```bash
python pharmgx_reporter.py --input demo_patient.txt --output report
```

**Demo result**: CYP2D6 \*4/\*4 (Poor Metabolizer) → **10 drugs AVOID** (codeine, tramadol, 7 TCAs, tamoxifen), 20 caution, 21 standard.

> ~7% of people are CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers — codeine gives them zero pain relief. ~0.5% carry DPYD variants where standard 5-FU dose can be lethal. This skill catches both.

### Ancestry PCA — *Population Scale*

Runs principal component analysis on your cohort against the SGDP reference panel (345 samples, 164 global populations):

- Contig normalisation (chr1 vs 1)
- IBD removal (related individuals filtered)
- Common biallelic SNPs only
- Confidence ellipses per population
- Publication-quality **4-panel figure** generated instantly

```bash
python ancestry_pca.py --demo --output ancestry_report
```

**Demo result**: 736 Peruvian samples across 28 indigenous populations. Amazonian groups (Matzes, Awajun, Candoshi) sit in genetic space that no SGDP population occupies — genuinely underrepresented, not just in GWAS, but in the reference panels themselves.

### Semantic Similarity Index — *Systemic Scale*

Computes a Semantic Isolation Index for diseases using 13.1M PubMed abstracts and PubMedBERT embeddings (768-dim):

- **SII** (Semantic Isolation Index): higher = more isolated in literature
- **KTP** (Knowledge Transfer Potential): higher = more cross-disease spillover
- **RCC** (Research Clustering Coefficient): diversity of research approaches
- **Temporal Drift**: how research focus evolves over time
- Publication-quality **4-panel figure**

```bash
python semantic_sim.py --demo --output sem_report
```

**Key finding**: Neglected tropical diseases are **+38% more semantically isolated** (P < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.84). 14 of the 25 most isolated diseases are Global South priority conditions. Knowledge silos kill innovation — a malaria immunology breakthrough could help leishmaniasis, but the literatures don't talk to each other.

- Bioinformatics tools for your skill of choice (see individual SKILL.md files)

### Install and run

```bash
# Install a skill
openclaw install skills/pharmgx-reporter

openclaw "Profile the pharmacogenes in my 23andMe file at data/raw_genotype.txt"

# Or run directly
python skills/pharmgx-reporter/pharmgx_reporter.py --input data/raw_genotype.txt --output report
```

Every skill includes **demo data** so you can try it immediately without your own files.

Each skill is standalone — the orchestrator routes to the right one, but every skill also works independently.
