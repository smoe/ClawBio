## What ClawBio Does Today

**14 skills and growing. Local-first. No cloud. No guessing.**

Snap a photo of a medication in Telegram. ClawBio identifies the drug from the packaging, queries your pharmacogenomic profile from [your own genome](docs/demo-genome.md), and returns a personalised dosage card — on your machine, in seconds:

<p align="center">
  <img src="skills/drug-photo/demo-images/00-00-warfarin.jpg" width="360" alt="Warfarin 2mg medication packaging — ClawBio identifies the drug from a photo and returns a personalised pharmacogenomic report">
</p>

> **Warfarin** | CYP2C9 \*1/\*2 Intermediate · VKORC1 High Sensitivity
> **AVOID — DO NOT USE** · Standard dose causes over-anticoagulation in this genotype.

Or take any genetic variant (identified by its rsID — a unique label like rs9923231) and search nine genomic databases at once to find every known disease association, tissue-specific effect, and population frequency. Or estimate your genetic predisposition to conditions like type 2 diabetes by combining thousands of small-effect variants into a single polygenic risk score. Or explore the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) — a half-million-person research dataset — by asking in plain English what fields measure blood pressure, grip strength, or depression, and get back the exact field IDs, descriptions, and linked publications you need.

Every result ships with a reproducibility bundle: `commands.sh`, `environment.yml`, and SHA-256 checksums. A reviewer can reproduce your Figure 3 in 30 seconds without emailing you.

---

## The Problem

You read a paper. You want to reproduce Figure 3. So you:

1. Go to GitHub. Clone the repo.
2. Wrong Python version. Fix dependencies.
3. Need the reference data — where is it?
4. Download 2GB from Zenodo. **Link is dead.**
5. Email the first author. **Wait 3 weeks.**
6. Paths are hardcoded to `/home/jsmith/data/`.
7. Two days later: still broken. **You give up.**

Now imagine the same paper published a **skill**:

```bash
python ancestry_pca.py --demo --output fig3
# Figure 3 reproduced. Identical. SHA-256 verified. 30 seconds.
```

**That's ClawBio.** Every figure in your paper should be one command away from reproduction.

---

## 🦖 What Is ClawBio?

A **skill** is a domain expert's knowledge — frozen into code — that an AI agent executes correctly every time.

```
ChatGPT / Claude  = a smart generalist who guesses at bioinformatics
🦖 ClawBio skill  = a domain expert's proven pipeline that the AI executes
```

- **Local-first**: Your genomic data never leaves your laptop. No cloud uploads, no data exfiltration.
- **Reproducible**: Every analysis exports `commands.sh`, `environment.yml`, and SHA-256 checksums. Anyone can reproduce it without the agent.
- **Modular**: Each skill is a self-contained directory (`SKILL.md` + Python scripts) that plugs into the orchestrator.
- **MIT licensed**: Open-source, free, community-driven.

## Why Not Just Use ChatGPT?

Ask Claude to "profile my pharmacogenes from this 23andMe file." It'll write plausible Python. But:

- It **hallucinates** star allele calls and uses outdated CPIC guidelines
- It **forgets** CYP2D6 \*4 is no-function (not reduced)
- You spend **45 minutes debugging** its output
- No reproducibility bundle. No audit log. No checksums.

ClawBio encodes the correct bioinformatics decisions so the agent gets it right first time, every time.

---

## 🔍 Provenance & Reproducibility

Every ClawBio analysis ships with a **reproducibility bundle** — not as an afterthought, but as part of the output:

```
report/
├── report.md              # Full analysis with figures and tables
├── figures/               # Publication-quality PNGs
├── tables/                # CSV data tables
├── commands.sh            # Exact commands to reproduce
├── environment.yml        # Conda environment snapshot
└── checksums.sha256       # SHA-256 of every input and output file
```

**Why this matters**: a reviewer can re-run your analysis in 30 seconds. A collaborator can reproduce your Figure 3 without emailing you. Future-you can regenerate results two years later from the same bundle.

## 🦖 MVP Skills in Detail

### PharmGx Reporter — *Personal Scale*

Generates a pharmacogenomic report from consumer genetic data (23andMe, AncestryDNA):

- Parses raw genetic data (auto-detects format, including gzip)
- Extracts **31 pharmacogenomic SNPs** across **12 genes** (CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, VKORC1, SLCO1B1, DPYD, TPMT, UGT1A1, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, NUDT15, CYP1A2)
- Calls star alleles and determines metabolizer phenotypes
- Looks up **CPIC drug recommendations** for **51 medications**
- Zero dependencies. Runs in **< 1 second**.

```bash
python pharmgx_reporter.py --input demo_patient.txt --output report
```

**Demo result**: CYP2D6 \*4/\*4 (Poor Metabolizer) → **10 drugs AVOID** (codeine, tramadol, 7 TCAs, tamoxifen), 20 caution, 21 standard.

> ~7% of people are CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers — codeine gives them zero pain relief. ~0.5% carry DPYD variants where standard 5-FU dose can be lethal. This skill catches both.

### Drug Photo — *Personal Scale*

Snap a photo of any medication in Telegram. ClawBio identifies the drug from the packaging and returns a personalised dosage card against your own genotype.

- Claude vision extracts drug name and visible dose from the photo
- Cross-references your 23andMe genotype against 31 PGx SNPs
- Four-tier classification: **STANDARD DOSING / USE WITH CAUTION / AVOID / INSUFFICIENT DATA**
- Correct VKORC1 complement-strand handling (23andMe reports minus strand for rs9923231)
- Works for warfarin, clopidogrel, codeine, simvastatin, tamoxifen, sertraline, and 20+ others

```bash
python pharmgx_reporter.py --drug warfarin --dose "5mg" --input my_23andme.txt --output report
```

> No command needed in Telegram — send any medication photo and RoboTerri triggers the skill automatically.

### GWAS Lookup — *Population Scale*

Federated variant query across nine genomic databases in a single command:

| Database | What you get |
|----------|-------------|
| GWAS Catalog | Genome-wide significant associations |
| gnomAD | Allele frequencies across 125,748 exomes |
| ClinVar | Clinical significance and condition links |
| Open Targets | Disease-gene evidence scores |
| Ensembl | Functional annotation, regulatory impact |
| GTEx | eQTL data, tissue-specific expression effects |
| LDlink | Linkage disequilibrium across 26 populations |
| UK Biobank PheWAS | Phenome-wide associations across 4,000+ traits |
| LOVD | Variant pathogenicity database |

```bash
python gwas_lookup.py --rsid rs3798220 --output report
python gwas_lookup.py --demo --output /tmp/gwas_lookup_demo
```

### UKB Navigator — *Research Scale*

Semantic search across the UK Biobank schema. Ask in plain English what UK Biobank measures about any phenotype — get field IDs, descriptions, data types, participant counts, and linked publications back instantly.

```bash
python ukb_navigator.py --query "grip strength"   --output report
python ukb_navigator.py --field 21001              --output report   # BMI
python ukb_navigator.py --demo                     --output /tmp/ukb_demo
```

Built on a ChromaDB embedding of the full UKB Data Showcase (22,000+ fields).

### Ancestry PCA — *Population Scale*

Runs principal component analysis on your cohort against the SGDP reference panel (345 samples, 164 global populations):

- Contig normalisation (chr1 vs 1)
- IBD removal (related individuals filtered)
- Common biallelic SNPs only
- Confidence ellipses per population
- Publication-quality **4-panel figure** generated instantly

```bash
python ancestry_pca.py --demo --output ancestry_report
```

**Demo result**: 736 Peruvian samples across 28 indigenous populations. Amazonian groups (Matzes, Awajun, Candoshi) sit in genetic space that no SGDP population occupies — genuinely underrepresented, not just in GWAS, but in the reference panels themselves.

### Semantic Similarity Index — *Systemic Scale*

Computes a Semantic Isolation Index for diseases using 13.1M PubMed abstracts and PubMedBERT embeddings (768-dim):

- **SII** (Semantic Isolation Index): higher = more isolated in literature
- **KTP** (Knowledge Transfer Potential): higher = more cross-disease spillover
- **RCC** (Research Clustering Coefficient): diversity of research approaches
- **Temporal Drift**: how research focus evolves over time
- Publication-quality **4-panel figure**

```bash
python semantic_sim.py --demo --output sem_report
```

**Key finding**: Neglected tropical diseases are **+38% more semantically isolated** (P < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.84). 14 of the 25 most isolated diseases are Global South priority conditions. Knowledge silos kill innovation — a malaria immunology breakthrough could help leishmaniasis, but the literatures don't talk to each other.
